## About this project

This project has been created to test with Inertia.js and Tailwind and to make a simple recipe searcher with it using Spoonacular API.

## How to run this project

Run the project like any other Laravel project.

Create a .env file with the following variables, you can get the API key and URL from [Spoonacular](https://spoonacular.com/food-api)

```
SPOONACULAR_API_KEY=
SPOONACULAR_API_URL=
```

## How to run the tests

Run the tests with the following command:

```
php artisan test
```

Only two tests have been created by myself and they are for the recipe searcher, the rest are the default ones that come with Laravel/Breeze.
